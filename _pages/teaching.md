<p>Based on my experience learning flintknapping, I have developed educational materials on lithics for students and instructors. These materials are available at the <a href="https://erareshide.github.io/lithics" target="_blank">Learning about Lithics</a> website. This website is an introduction to stone tools and provide a sense of the knapperâ€™s perspective and decision-making process. Photos and short videos show basic knapping techniques, including hard hammer percussion, soft hammer percussion, and pressure flaking.</p>
